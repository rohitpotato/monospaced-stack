Hey, rohit here.

This is a digital backyard i created to jot down my thoughts about `programming`, `infrastructure`, and ocassionally, something personal.

I am a senior frontend engineer currently working at Zepto (yes, the 10 minute-app), focusing on performance for [zeptonow.com](https://zeptonow.com).

I mostly care about exploring new topics, watching a ton of movies, pc games and now, as i grow older - I've been getting my interior design game on track. Building a desk setup right about now.

Having spent several years on frontend, I am now delving into some other aspects, I'm now exploring adjacent areas like infrastructure, devops, and platform engineering. This website, for example, runs on a bare-metal setup, built with an arguably over-engineered stack that includes:

1. k3s
2. ArgoCD
3. Vault in HA
4. External Secrets Operator
5. Helm and Kustomize
6. Kube-prometheus stack with loki
7. Ansible

and a lot more that i will write about here, so feel free to explore.

You can reach me on [twitter (or X)](https://x.com/rohitpotato), and checkout some of what i do at [github](https://github.com/rohitpotato).

I like music, if you like music too, take a crack at my [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3P5GZ53gZN40M0R0OuvIXj?si=681bb4c450d24817) here, and if you are curious how i track analytics down here, check [this](https://analytics.rohitpotato.xyz/share/hngHuG0JCGdsYDU3/rohitpotato.xyz)
