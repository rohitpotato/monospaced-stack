Why I Switched from Frontend to Infrastructure: A Developer’s Quest for Control

I’ve been a frontend developer for years, building slick UIs, crafting design systems, and obsessing over Core Web Vitals for fast-paced e-commerce products. I’ve wrestled with Webpack configs, optimized Lighthouse scores, and shipped pixel-perfect interfaces that made customers click “Add to Cart” without a hitch. It was rewarding, sure, but somewhere along the way, I hit a wall. I wasn’t learning anything new. The codebases changed, the frameworks evolved, but the core of my work—React components, CSS-in-JS, performance tweaks—felt like a loop I couldn’t escape.

What bugged me most wasn’t the work itself. It was the black box I was working in. I’d push code to Git, watch it magically deploy via some managed service like Vercel or Netlify, and call it a day. But how did it get there? What happened between my git push and the app going live? I had no clue. I’d nod along in meetings when backend folks talked about CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure teams mentioned “Kubernetes” or “load balancers,” but deep down, I felt like an impostor. I could optimize a webpage to load in under a second, but if you asked me how the server handled traffic or what a “pod” was, I’d mumble something vague and change the subject.

It wasn’t about proving anything to anyone else. I didn’t care about looking smart in meetings. I just wanted to know—really know—how things worked. I was tired of being at the mercy of managed services, blindly trusting that someone else’s black box would keep my app running. I wanted to own the stack, from the code I wrote to the servers it ran on. Not just the frontend, but the whole damn thing. I wanted the confidence to say, “Yeah, I know how that’s deployed, and I can make it better.”

So, I took a leap. I bought two VPS servers from netcup—nothing fancy, just a couple of bare-metal machines I could mess around with. My goal wasn’t to build a production-ready system overnight. It was to start from scratch, break things, fix them, and figure out what terms like “CNI” or “GitOps” actually meant. I chose K3s, a lightweight version of Kubernetes, because it seemed like a manageable way to dip my toes into the infrastructure world without drowning in complexity.

The first few weeks were humbling. I’d spent years mastering React hooks, but now I was Googling “how to SSH into a server” and staring at YAML files like they were alien hieroglyphs. I set up my two-node K3s cluster, and let me tell you, nothing prepares you for the moment when kubectl get nodes shows your cluster is actually running. It was like seeing my first React app render in the browser all over again—pure excitement mixed with a bit of “wait, did I actually do that?”

From there, I dove into networking with Cilium, played with ArgoCD to automate deployments, and wrestled with Vault to secure secrets (because plaintext environment variables are apparently a cardinal sin). I used Ansible to harden my Linux nodes and automate K3s setup, and I even got Grafana and Prometheus running to monitor my cluster. Each step felt like unlocking a new level in a game I didn’t fully understand yet, but I was hooked. Every error message, every failed pod, was a chance to learn something I’d been clueless about before.

This journey isn’t about becoming a DevOps guru overnight. It’s about scratching that itch to understand the full stack—not just the part that renders in Chrome. It’s about the satisfaction of knowing that when I deploy an app, I’m not just pushing code into a void. I’m controlling the servers, the networking, the security, the whole shebang. And yeah, it’s messy sometimes. I’ve spent hours debugging why my Vault node wouldn’t unseal or why my ingress wasn’t routing traffic. But every fix makes me feel like I’m not just a frontend developer anymore—I’m someone who can build and run a system from the ground up.

If you’re a developer who’s ever felt stuck, wondering what’s happening behind the scenes of your app, this series is for you. I’m not here to lecture or show off. I’m just sharing what I’ve learned, step by step, as I go from frontend comfort zone to infrastructure unknown. Next up, I’ll walk you through the basics of Kubernetes—pods, deployments, services—and how I got my K3s cluster running on those two VPS servers. If I can figure it out, so can you. Let’s dive in.

Try This: If you’re curious about infrastructure, grab a cheap VPS or even a local VM and try installing K3s. Just run curl -sfL get.k3s.io | sh - and see what happens. Share your experience in the comments—I’d love to hear how it goes!
